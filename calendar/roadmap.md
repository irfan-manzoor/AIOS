# AIOS Project Roadmap

**Goal**: Design and build an AI Operating System for autonomous deep-space exploration and multi-agent coordination.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 0: Foundations (Aug–Sep 2025)

- ✅ Learn Python, Linux, and CLI workflows
- ✅ Complete linear algebra and calculus review
- ✅ Build a CLI tool to scrape, parse, and clean sensor-like data
- ✅ Simulate file/log monitoring agents in Python

---

## 🤖 Phase 1: ML Core Prototype (Oct–Dec 2025)

- 🎯 Build your first ML model pipeline
- 🎯 Implement backpropagation from scratch
- ✅ Train and test models on real datasets (classification, regression)
- 🛠 Create early ML interface layer for agents (input → model → output)

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: ML Systems & Edge Deployment (Jan–Mar 2026)

- 🛠 Deploy an ML model to run locally on CPU with retry/fallback logic
- 🧪 Build logging, retraining, and error reporting system
- 🎯 Version data, models, and artifacts using Git+DVC
- 🧠 Design modular interface between ML subsystem and OS core

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Robotics + Multi-Agent Core (Apr–Jun 2026)

- 🧭 Build swarm exploration simulator (e.g., 3–5 agents in unknown terrain)
- 🎯 Implement inter-agent communication using sockets or message bus (ZeroMQ/MQTT)
- 🔄 Simulate anomaly handling (agent lost, communication failure, override logic)
- 🧠 Design agent architecture (sensing, planning, control loop)

---

## 🛡️ Phase 4: Safety, Alignment, and Deployment Planning (Jun–Jul 2026)

- ✅ Draft system-wide failure handling protocol
- ✅ Add safety override and consensus mechanism (majority-vote, quorum)
- 🛰 Build a sample space mission plan with autonomous agent roles
- 🎯 Prototype `AIOS Control Core`:
  - Mission planner
  - Fleet communication interface
  - Fault-tolerant safety monitor

---

## 🧪 Long-Term Vision (Post–Jul 2026)

- 🔬 Integrate cognitive architecture (e.g., Soar/ACT-R shell)
- 🧠 Explore hybrid AGI control for fleet-wide intelligence
- 🌌 Prepare formal specs for embedded deployment (RISC-V, MCUs, RTOS)
- 🚀 Collaborate with open-space or planetary simulation environments

---

## 📁 Deliverables

- `/docs/specs/` — Full architecture diagrams and system design
- `/src/aios/` — Core agent logic, mission planner, ML interfaces
- `/sim/` — Swarm, robotics, fault simulations
- `/experiments/` — TinyML, anomaly recovery, distributed learning
